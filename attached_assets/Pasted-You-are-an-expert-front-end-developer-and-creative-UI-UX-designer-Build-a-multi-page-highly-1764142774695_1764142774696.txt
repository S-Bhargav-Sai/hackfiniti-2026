You are an expert front-end developer and creative UI/UX designer.

Build a **multi-page**, highly interactive website for a 24-hour national-level hackathon called **HACKFINITI 2026**, hosted by **B V Raju Institute of Technology (BVRIT)**.

⚠️ IMPORTANT:
- Do **NOT** make this a single-page site.
- Create **multiple HTML pages** with smooth navigation between them.
- The feel should be **playful, festival-like, and interactive**, similar in spirit to moodi.org (Mood Indigo IIT Bombay), but with a **futuristic neon hackathon** theme.

--------------------------------
TECH + FILE STRUCTURE
--------------------------------
Create a small multi-page website with this structure:

- `index.html`        → Home / Landing
- `about.html`        → About the hackathon
- `themes.html`       → Themes / Tracks
- `details.html`      → Event details (rounds, dates, rules, prizes)
- `faq.html`          → FAQs
- `contact.html`      → Contact & social links
- `styles.css`        → Common styles (imported by all pages)
- `scripts.js`        → Common interactivity (imported by all pages)
- `assets/`           → Placeholder for images/icons if needed

Use:
- **HTML5**, **CSS3 (Flexbox + Grid)**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.
- No React/Angular/Bootstrap. Keep it as static multi-page site.
- You may use:
  - **Google Fonts**
  - Icon libraries (e.g., Remix Icons / Font Awesome via CDN)

All pages must share a **consistent navbar + footer** so it feels like one unified experience.

--------------------------------
VISUAL & INTERACTION STYLE
--------------------------------
Overall vibe:
- Futuristic, neon, festival-tech style.
- Inspired by interactive event sites like Mood Indigo.

Design:
- Dark background (near-black) with **animated neon gradients** (purple, cyan, magenta, blue).
- Use **glassmorphism cards**:
  - Transparent panels with blur, neon borders, glow shadows.
- Headings:
  - Futuristic font (e.g., Orbitron/Audiowide for titles).
  - Clean modern font (e.g., Poppins/Inter) for body.

Interactivity & animation:
- Smooth page transitions:
  - On each page load, use a simple JS animation (e.g., fade-in + slide-up of main content).
- Elements respond to:
  - Hover (scale + glow)
  - Mouse movement (slight parallax on hero backgrounds or blobs)
- Use **CSS keyframes** for:
  - Animated gradient backgrounds
  - Floating blobs / shapes
- Use **JavaScript** for:
  - Mobile navbar toggle
  - Scroll-based animations (IntersectionObserver or onscroll)
  - Simple micro-interactions like “particle” dots moving slowly in the background (optional)

--------------------------------
COMMON LAYOUT ON ALL PAGES
--------------------------------
